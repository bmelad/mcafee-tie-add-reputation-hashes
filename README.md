# McAfee TIE - Add reputation hashes
This little script allows you to add a list of hashes to your TIE reputations list automatically instead of doing it manually.


## How to use it?

First, Edit the basic details in the top of the script (epo address, port, credentials, reputation value & comment).

Now, just choose your preferred running method:

 - **Method #1:** Send a list of hashes as arguments (like: .\mcafee-tie-add-reputation-hashes.ps1 hash1 hash2 hash3 ...)
 - **Method #2:** List your hashes in a text file named "hashes.txt" and save it in the same path as the script.
